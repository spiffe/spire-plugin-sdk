    // 2. SPIRE Server sends a request containing the attestation payload
    //    received from the agent.
    // 3. Optionally, the plugin responds with a challenge:
    //    3a. SPIRE Server sends the challenge to the agent.
    //    3b. SPIRE Agent responds with the challenge response.
    //    3c. SPIRE Server sends the challenge response to the plugin.
    //    3d. Step 3 is repeated until the plugin is satisfied and does
    //        not respond with an additional challenge.
    // 4. The plugin returns the attestation results to SPIRE Server and closes
    //    the stream.
